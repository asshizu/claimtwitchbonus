# claimtwitchbonus
Automatically claims twitch channel points without you having to do anything!

Open the console tab of your browser's inspect element and paste the code inside claimer.js into the console.

Please note it will not claim the bonus instantly, due to lag reasons.

TIP: wait until the gift box appears on screen before you run the code, so you won't have to wait an extra five minutes!

TIP: if you do wait until the gift box appears, you can change the sleep value to just above five to claim the points even faster!
